The Marshmallow Challenge, promoted by Canadian technology expert Tom Ujek, has been conducted  around the world with architects and engineers, CEOs, lawyers, business graduates, and even  kindergartners.  Over the years, the challenge has produced some surprising results.  In Ujek's study, the average height of the structures constructed was 20 inches.  The group that built the highest structure was, as expected, architects and engineers.  CEOs performed slightly better than average, coming in third.  Lawyers, on the other hand, performed below average, ranking second to last.  And despite working to create the best plan, business graduates performed the worst.  Amazingly, kindergartners outperformed most of the adult teams to achieve the second-best  performance.
